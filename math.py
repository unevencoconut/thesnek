# Math
# Python has built in Math Functions and a Math Module

# Starting wit all the built in Python Functions

# Find the Lowest or Highest Value in an Iterable
x = min(5,10,25)
y = max(5,10,25)

print(x)
print(y)

# abs() returns the Absolute ( Postivie ) value of specific number
x = abs(-7.25)
print(x)

# Power - returns the value of x to the power of y
x = pow(4,3)
print(x)


# Now that you know all the built in functions
# You can import the built in Math Module which extends Math Functions
import math

dir(math)
# x = math.sqrt(64)
# print(x)
